# signature-verification

A study of using deep learning for signature verification inspired by South Korean television series "Start-Up". 
In this case study, I have trained and tested the model on **ICDAR 2009 Signature Verification Competition Dataset**.
Hope you guys enjoy exploring my notebooks! ðŸ˜Š
